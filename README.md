# Snake-Game

I created this Snake Game as a modern reimagining of the classic arcade favorite, blending retro gameplay with fun, engaging features. In the game, you control a snake that moves around the board, eating food to grow longer and earn points. The challenge is to avoid running into the edges of the board or your own tail, making every move critical. To enhance the experience, I added a "ding" sound effect that plays every time the snake eats food, while a "game-over" sound provides a dramatic moment when the game ends. For an immersive touch, thereâ€™s looping jungle-themed background music that plays throughout the game.

I paid special attention to the visual design to make it appealing. The food is bright and stands out clearly on the board. To guide players, I included a helpful "Press Arrow Keys to Start" message that disappears as soon as they make their first move. For replayability, I added a functional restart button so players can instantly jump back into the game. The game also tracks both the current score and the high score. Overall, this project was a fun mix of classic mechanics, creative visuals, and interactive features, making it an enjoyable experience for all.
